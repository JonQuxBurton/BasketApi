# Basket REST API

## Overview

This describes the resources that make up the prototype Basket REST API.

The design of the API is modeled on the following references:

["Building a RESTful API with ASP.NET Core" Pluralsight course by Kevin Dockx](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-restful-api-building/table-of-contents)

[API Design by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

[REST API v3 by Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

All API access is over HTTP. All data is sent and received as JSON.

## Features

The following is a list of all the features which the API contains.
Note: the URLs below should be prefixed with the host and port, for example: http://localhost:57332/api

All these requests are contained on the following Postman collection: https://github.com/JonQuxBurton/BasketApi/blob/master/BasketApi.postman_collection.json

## Projects

The projects in the solution are as follows:

### BasketApi
The Basket REST API. This is currently setup to use an InMemory datastore. In production this can be replaced by registering the production data store in the composition root (Startup.cs).

### BasketApiClient
A project which allows clients to use the API more easily.

### BasketApiConsoleApp
A sample console app which uses the BasketApiClient to exercise the API.
